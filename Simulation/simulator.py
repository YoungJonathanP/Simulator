simulator.py

Version: 1.0

The main purposes of this program are:
    - Control creation of actors within Carla.
    - Retrieve simulated sensor data from actors and send to router board.
    - Interpret actuation data from router board and send actuation commands to Carla.

Much of the code that prepares the simulation (spawning actors and sensors) can be found in the examples
that come with the CARLA simulator download.

CARLA open-source simulator can be found here: http://Carla.org/
